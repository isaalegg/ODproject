# RevelioCharm 
***RevelioCharm*** is a mobile interface that allows you to locate where you left the things that you usually lose on a daily basis.

## Description
Through *computer vision* technology, RevelioCharm identifies small objects in images provided by users. The image is processed by an Object detection model and its output is the same image in which the location of the lost object is framed.
